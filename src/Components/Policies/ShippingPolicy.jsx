          <h3>Stock Availability</h3>
          <p>
            We work hard to keep our website inventory accurate and up to date.
            In the unlikely event that a product you ordered is unavailable, we
            will get in touch with you to arrange either a restock timeline or a
            refund.
          </p>

          <h3>Shipping Costs</h3>
          <p>
            Shipping charges are calculated automatically at checkout based on
            the order weight, package dimensions, and delivery location. The
            final shipping amount will be clearly shown before you confirm your
            purchase.
          </p>

          <h3>Order Processing & Dispatch</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Ready-to-Ship Products:</strong> Generally dispatched
              within 5 business days of payment confirmation.

            <li>
              <strong>Mixed Orders:</strong> If your order includes both
              ready-to-ship and made-to-order items, available items will be
              dispatched first, and the rest will follow once prepared.
            </li>
          </ul>
