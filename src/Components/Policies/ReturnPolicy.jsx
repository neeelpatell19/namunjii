            <li>The product was damaged on arrival.</li>
            <li>You received the wrong product.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How to Request an Exchange</h3>
          <p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Submitting an exchange request directly through your order page on
              the Namunjii website, or

            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Exchange Conditions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Products must be unused, in original condition, and with all
              original packaging, labels, and tags intact.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exchange requests made after 7 days of delivery will not be
              accepted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once your request is approved, our logistics partner will arrange
              the pickup and delivery of the replacement product.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Shipping Costs</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For approved exchanges due to defective, damaged, or wrong
              product, the cost of pickup and redelivery will be borne by the
              designer/brand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Customers do not have to pay any additional exchange shipping
              charges.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Important Notes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Refunds are not provided under any circumstances.</li>
            <li>
              Exchange is limited to a replacement of the same product (same
              style, different size in case available) or a corrected item.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a replacement is not available, Namunjii will work with the
              designer/brand to provide an alternative solution.
            </li>
          </ul>
